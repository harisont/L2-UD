-- Known issues: some errors that are, according to the SweLL taxonomy, 
-- classified as O-Comp, are treated as morphosyntactical too. This is the
-- case with, for instance, split compounds. 
-- NOTE on implementation: the hacky way I implemented this is to compare the
-- corresponding simplified (cf. simplifyUDPattern) UD patterns in HST
